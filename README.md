# Teamtreehouse Webdevelopement Techdegree - Unit 10
## Creating a library manager with Node.js, Express, Pug, Sequelize and SQLite 
*By DoKe65 (Doris Keller)*  

In this 10th project of Teamtreehouses Web Development Techdegree we're asked to create a library manager for an existing SQLite Database.

The goal was to create a user friendly site that allows listing of books, adding new books, deleting and edition existing books. In addition, there's a pagination functionallity as well as the possibility to search for a book. 

Downside: No realtime search, but the need to press the Search button or press enter to start a search.
